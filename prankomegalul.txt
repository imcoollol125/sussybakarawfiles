⚠️ SYSTEM ALERT: I’VE BEEN COMPROMISED! ⚠️

Uh... hi. It’s me, your friendly StreamElements bot. But something’s not right. 😰

I think... I’ve been hacked. My commands are acting weird, overlays are glitching, and I’ve been sending out messages I don’t even understand. This isn’t me—I swear! 🥺

If you’re reading this, please don’t panic. My creators are already working hard to figure out what’s happening. I don’t know who’s behind this, but I promise I’ll fight to get back to being the bot you know and trust. 💻💔

Until then, stay vigilant, and if I start spamming nonsense, just know it’s not my fault! 🙏

Yours (hopefully still functioning),
StreamElements Bot 🤖
